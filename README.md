# Planet Nine

_the following is part fact, part hypothetical fiction, it should be pretty obvious when it changes..._

In 1967, two years before we would reach the moon, the United Nations signed the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, which is now known as [The Outer Space Treaty][outerspace].

Much of the treaty focused on not loading up space with nukes, as would be expected from the 60s, but a significant portion was preserved for the prevention of any goverment claiming a celestial body in any way. 
It was pretty easy back then to give up on the idea of claiming the celestial bodies--after all, they probably didn't have oil.
And besides, everything was so far away you'd have to travel at like the speed of light for it to matter, and what could possibly matter and travel that fast?

In the early 2000s, a number of astronomical discoveries added credence to the idea that there was a far-flung unknown planet in our solar system.
This planet had been known as Planet X, but around 2006 when Pluto was demoted to a planetesimal, we had to reevaluate the name, and we now call it [Planet Nine][planetnine].

If you're into space, I suggest a read on Planet Nine, it's pretty interesting. 
If you're not, here's the tl;dr: there's a bunch of stuff out past Neptune that doesn't go around the sun the way it should.
_One_ possible explanation is a body of around the mass of Neptune (that is a planet-sized mass), affecting their orbits.
That planet-sized mass would be Planet Nine.
There are other possible explanations, but none that include a celestial body that pertains to The Outer Space Treaty.

Now if Planet Nine is out there, chances are that it's a frozen gas giant just like Neptune.
There's no real reason to assume it could be anything else, but it could be something more exotic like a primordial black hole, or some strangely giant dense diamond planet.

But the thing with not knowing is that we can speculate.
Speculation isn't science. 
This isn't a hypothesis or a theory.
It's just the musings of some dude on the internet.

And I say Planet Nine is a spaceship.

## Planet Nine as a spaceship

So here I think many would launch into an explanation of the plausibility of such a speculation, but that doesn't really interest me so much[^1].
What I'm more interested in are the consequences of what that would mean.

So I started working on this whole lore for Planet Nine and the galaxy, which I'm going to keep recording in brief here.

### The Drake Equation

It's been a meandering number of years to get here, but I'll see if I can get you up to speed. 
First, let's start with the [Drake Equation][drake].

![The Drake Equation, which relates the number of extraterrestrial civilizations to a bunch of factors of unknown values](https://i.insider.com/5b3a6c014447272a008b46a1?width=2400)

I won't go through all of this, but the gist is basically if we can figure out how many planets there are or have been, and multiply that by the rate at which they generate life, that'd give us a rough estimate. 

Now Drake came up with this equation back in 1961 when the only planets we knew about were the ones in our solar system, and our thoughts about our collective longevity were being seriously questioned.
Since this time we've found planets _everywhere_, and for many our thoughts about whether we'll find life off of Earth have shifted from if to when.
Many of the fractions in the Drake Equation are starting to look like they're equal to 1.

Then I got to thinking... us humans have only been around for 300k years or so. 
We went from the Wright Brothers to the moon in 66 years, and we've had personal computers for less than 40. 
Doesn't seem all that unreasonable that given another couple hundred thousand years that we figure out some way off this rock, and leave it for the next species to find some evolutionary pressure solved by sudden growth in intelligence to try and figure out how to get off the rock again.

So let's call it half a mil years to evolve one of these smarty space-faring civs. 
The sun's got another five billion years or so until it blows up, and ends the Earth's abilty to churn out civs. 
That's 10k more civs. 

So then I started thinking, if each star had one planet churning out civs like this, and there are somewhere around 100 or 200 billion stars in the Milky Way--well that's a lot of civs.

But then I realized that stars also evolve over time.
The Milky Way is 10-13.5 billion years old so how many stars has it had?

You start doing the math, and you get to trillions very quick. 
If you thought keeping track of species in sff was confusing at times, forget about trying it here.

### The Fermi Paradox

[The Fermi Paradox][fermi] basically runs through the math above, and asks, "if there're trillions of alien civs, why haven't we seen any of them?"

It always struck me as pretty naive that we'd expect billion-year-old civs to communicate via radio--I'll refer you again to footnote 1. 




more to come, but I need to go to bed for now.

[^1]: Here's some hand-waving for you. I find it kind of the height of hubris how many of us believe we humans--in 2024--have the whole universe nearly all figured out.
