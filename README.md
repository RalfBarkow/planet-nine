# Planet Nine

_the following is part fact, part hypothetical fiction, it should be pretty obvious when it changes..._

In 1967, two years before we would reach the moon, the United Nations signed the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, which is now known as [The Outer Space Treaty][outerspace].

Much of the treaty focused on not loading up space with nukes, as would be expected from the 60s, but a significant portion was preserved for the prevention of any goverment claiming a celestial body in any way. 
It was pretty easy back then to give up on the idea of claiming the celestial bodies--after all, they probably didn't have oil.
And besides, everything was so far away you'd have to travel at like the speed of light for it to matter, and what could possibly matter and travel that fast?

In the early 2000s, a number of astronomical discoveries added credence to the idea that there was a far-flung unknown planet in our solar system.
This planet had been known as Planet X, but around 2006 when Pluto was demoted to a planetesimal, we had to reevaluate the name, and we now call it [Planet Nine][planetnine].

If you're into space, I suggest a read on Planet Nine, it's pretty interesting. 
If you're not, here's the tl;dr: there's a bunch of stuff out past Neptune that doesn't go around the sun the way it should.
_One_ possible explanation is a body of around the mass of Neptune (that is a planet-sized mass), affecting their orbits.
That planet-sized mass would be Planet Nine.
There are other possible explanations, but none that include a celestial body that pertains to The Outer Space Treaty.

Now if Planet Nine is out there, chances are that it's a frozen gas giant just like Neptune.
There's no real reason to assume it could be anything else, but it could be something more exotic like a primordial black hole, or some strangely giant dense diamond planet.

But the thing with not knowing is that we can speculate.
Speculation isn't science. 
This isn't a hypothesis or a theory.
It's just the musings of some dude on the internet.

And I say Planet Nine is a spaceship.

## Planet Nine as a spaceship

So here I think many would launch into an explanation of the plausibility of such a speculation, but that doesn't really interest me so much[^1].
What I'm more interested in are the consequences of what that would mean.

So I started working on this whole lore for Planet Nine and the galaxy, which I'm going to keep recording in brief here, but I need to go to bed for now.

[^1]: Here's some hand-waving for you. I find it kind of the height of hubris how many of us believe we humans--in 2024--have the whole universe nearly all figured out.
