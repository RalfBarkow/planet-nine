# Planet Nine

_the following is part fact, part hypothetical fiction, it should be pretty obvious when it changes..._

In 1967, two years before we would reach the moon, the United Nations signed the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, which is now known as [The Outer Space Treaty][outerspace].

Much of the treaty focused on not loading up space with nukes, as would be expected from the 60s, but a significant portion was preserved for the prevention of any goverment claiming a celestial body in any way. 
It was pretty easy back then to give up on the idea of claiming the celestial bodies--after all, they probably didn't have oil.
And besides, everything was so far away you'd have to travel at like the speed of light for it to matter, and what could possibly matter and travel that fast?

In the early 2000s, a number of astronomical discoveries added credence to the idea that there was a far-flung unknown planet in our solar system.
This planet had been known as Planet X, but around 2006 when Pluto was demoted to a planetesimal, we had to reevaluate the name, and we now call it [Planet Nine][planetnine].

If you're into space, I suggest a read on Planet Nine, it's pretty interesting. 
If you're not, here's the tl;dr: there's a bunch of stuff out past Neptune that doesn't go around the sun the way it should.
_One_ possible explanation is a body of around the mass of Neptune (that is a planet-sized mass), affecting their orbits.
That planet-sized mass would be Planet Nine.
There are other possible explanations, but none that include a celestial body that pertains to The Outer Space Treaty.

Now if Planet Nine is out there, chances are that it's a frozen gas giant just like Neptune.
There's no real reason to assume it could be anything else, but it could be something more exotic like a primordial black hole, or some strangely giant dense diamond planet.

But the thing with not knowing is that we can speculate.
Speculation isn't science. 
This isn't a hypothesis or a theory.
It's just the musings of some dude on the internet.

And I say Planet Nine is a spaceship.

## Planet Nine as a spaceship

So here I think many would launch into an explanation of the plausibility of such a speculation, but that doesn't really interest me so much[^1].
What I'm more interested in are the consequences of what that would mean.

So I started working on this whole lore for Planet Nine and the galaxy, which I'm going to keep recording in brief here.

### The Drake Equation

It's been a meandering number of years to get here, but I'll see if I can get you up to speed. 
First, let's start with the [Drake Equation][drake].

![The Drake Equation, which relates the number of extraterrestrial civilizations to a bunch of factors of unknown values](https://i.insider.com/5b3a6c014447272a008b46a1?width=2400)

I won't go through all of this, but the gist is basically if we can figure out how many planets there are or have been, and multiply that by the rate at which they generate life, that'd give us a rough estimate. 

Now Drake came up with this equation back in 1961 when the only planets we knew about were the ones in our solar system, and our thoughts about our collective longevity were being seriously questioned.
Since this time we've found planets _everywhere_, and for many our thoughts about whether we'll find life off of Earth have shifted from if to when.
Many of the fractions in the Drake Equation are starting to look like they're equal to 1.

Then I got to thinking... us humans have only been around for 300k years or so. 
We went from the Wright Brothers to the moon in 66 years, and we've had personal computers for less than 40. 
Doesn't seem all that unreasonable that given another couple hundred thousand years that we figure out some way off this rock, and leave it for the next species to find some evolutionary pressure solved by sudden growth in intelligence to try and figure out how to get off the rock again.

So let's call it half a mil years to evolve one of these smarty space-faring civs. 
The sun's got another five billion years or so until it blows up, and ends the Earth's abilty to churn out civs. 
That's 10k more civs. 

So then I started thinking, if each star had one planet churning out civs like this, and there are somewhere around 100 or 200 billion stars in the Milky Way--well that's a lot of civs.

But then I realized that stars also evolve over time.
The Milky Way is 10-13.5 billion years old so how many stars has it had?

You start doing the math, and you get to trillions very quick. 
If you thought keeping track of species in sff was confusing at times, forget about trying it here.

### The Fermi Paradox

[The Fermi Paradox][fermi] basically runs through the math above, and asks, "if there're trillions of alien civs, why haven't we seen any of them?"

It always struck me as pretty naive that we'd expect billion-year-old civs to communicate via radio--I'll refer you again to footnote 1. 
Most of the universe does not interact with the electro-magnetic field, which suggests, since things in Physics prefer low-energy states to high-energy states, that communicating with light might be a rather primitive way of communicating to anyone who's been broadcasting for more than a century or two.

Gravitational waves were detected like a decade ago, and it took two black holes 30 times the mass of the sun to merge for us to see them. 
If aliens are using gravity to communicate, we wouldn't hear them yet.
And if they're using dark matter or dark energy, then we'd have ever farther to go since we can't detect either of those things yet. 

One of the numbers in the Drake equation is the amount of time that a civ spends at a technological level where we might interact with them.
The usual presumption, because we humans think we're the best around, is that we've hit the peak, and other civs just need to get to our level to be found.
If the average length of time a civ lasts after discovering radio is the like the 200 years between when we did, and when climate change dooms us, then there's not much hope of us all overlapping.

But let's suppose, for the sake of imagining, that there are some civs that are able to figure things out, and last not just centuries, but millenia, and tens of millenia, and hundreds of millenia, and thousands of millenia, and thousands and thousands of millenia into the future.
I'd reckon they'd have some stories, and some technology beyond what we've even dreamed of.

### Billions and billions

We humans don't have a really good sense of long periods of time. 
Other than Dr. Who, we don't really have any science fiction that worries about things billions of years in the future or past. 
We hear things like the sun will blow up in five billion years, but that's longer than the Earth's been around, and both of those events are utterly unfathomable both in cosmic-scale, and lengths of time.

Now think about what humans could accomplish in multiple billions of years.

Now think about what some sentient characters who are just a tiny bit more adept at being cool could accomplish in multiple billions of years.

The Milky Way's been around somewhere around 13 billion years. 
It has contained maybe half a trillion stars.
Each of those stars probably had planets and moons.

The two last terms in the Drake equation are the fraction of civs that develop tech that releases detectable signals, and the length of time they make these signals.
I think that's kind of an unimaginative place to stop the tech tree. 
What about teleportation? Faster than light travel? Multiversal traversal? Wormholes? Stuff we haven't even thought of?

Because you know if there're any creature like us out there with a little more time under their belts, they're gonna try and figure out how to get from one star to another. 
And you know we're gonna do that too.
How long do you think it's going to take us? 

### They're already here

Life on Earth started around four billion years ago.
Let's say some other solar system formed around the beginning of the Milky Way, and had four billion years to load up a planet in itself with clever creatures.
That gives _nine billion_ years for those creatures to figure out how to find other creatures.
Idk, seems doable to me.

Some small group of them acts as a vanguard, looking for up and coming spacefaring civs to interact with.
Maybe they have some rules that help govern those interactions. 

One of the potential solutions to the Fermi Paradox is called the [Zoo hypothesis][zoo].
The zoo hypothesis says basically that Earth is treated by extraterrestrials the way that humanity treats the Sentinelese of North Sentinel Island.
That is they're left alone.

Now the Sentinelese may not cross the water to India and threaten the most populated country on Earth, but you know the rest of us are going to be hopping on spaceships, and messing up shit in the stars as soon as we're able.
I imagine we're not alone in that need to explore, and I imagine that in the thirteen billion years the Milky Way's been around, that vanguard has run into a couple of those species as well.

Humanity doesn't have a ton of examples of an advanced group of people encountering a less advanced group of people and having the former not do terrible things to the latter.
But we do have a bit of an analog in the form of domesticated animals--the closest thing we have to species that are way behind us on the tech tree.
So long as you're cool with us, and give us some stuff, we'll take care of you and keep you around.
Sure sometimes that's in horrible conditions, but we're the same ones who might just be [worse than a giant asteroid][asteroid][^2].

So the vanguard goes around looking for species to help with some cause. 
And I'd imagine they look out for threats to that cause too. 
And let the developing species out of the "zoo" once it's ready.

Now let's say you've spent billions of years travelling the galaxy with the purpose of finding and sheltering civs until they're ready to join whatever it is you want them to join. 
How do you convince them that you're not a threat?

You can't just show up, chances are they have plenty of media of what an alien invasion looks like (and how it can be thwarted by some good ol' American yeehawin').
And if you come to late you run the risk of them reaching a point where they can do some damage to your enterprise. 

Over time you learn that civs hit the spacefaring stage at similar states on the tech ladder: eloctromagnetic communication, nuclear power, getting close to traveling to other planets, weirdly dealing with their inability to share ample resources effectively across their world...you know, the usj.
So the sweet spot is showing up long before these civs evolve, set up shop in a way that hints to your presence, but takes just the right level of technology to find you, keeps you at a close enough distance to communicate, but far enough away to avoid those nukes.

There's a huge chunk of astronomy that can be explained as, "that doesn't move exactly like it should, so there must be something out there." 
That's what makes some scientists believe in the existence of Planet Nine. 

As far as I'm concerned it's doing exactly what I would do if I was going to watch humans evolve to some state where they could join my galactic federation. 
And to me it's even more believable that Planet Nine doesn't want to be found, than we haven't been abe to see it.






more to come, but I need to go to bed for now.

[^2]: Apologies for the flippant invokation of a possible sixth epochal extinction event. I don't mention it as any sort of justification for the brutal treatment of many domesticated animals. It's just not the soapbox I need to get on right now.
